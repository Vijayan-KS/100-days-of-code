### Day 4: September 03, 2022(Saturday)

**Today's Progress**: Learn about Space Complexity

**Thoughts**: Today I invest 30m only for learning DSA concept but in upcomming days I push myself to spend at least 1hr in dsa 

### Day 5: September 04, 2022(Sunday)

**Today's Progress**: Learn about, 
 1. Some basic Math concept  
 2. Sieve of Eratosthenes Algorithm    
 3. Euclidean Algorithm  

**Solve**: Find Median of given ordered array

**Thoughts**: Sunday 1st half I complete spend for DSA 2nd half take a break

### Day 6: September 05, 2022(Monday)

**Today's Progress**: started leetcode study plan Programming skills 1(solve day1 problem) + learn about how to solve prime factor problem in Math chapter

**Thoughts**: monday is quite well

### Day 7: September 06, 2022(Tuesday)

**Today's Progress**: solve day2 problem in leetcode study plan + complete 2.10, 2.12, 2.13 tutorial in GFG DSA self paced course(Math problems)

**Thoughts**: Tuesday have more time so I work on DSA + allocate some time for Movie time

### Day 8: September 07, 2022(Wednesday)

**Today's Progress**: solve day3 problem in leetcode study plan + solve 2 GFG math related problems

**Thoughts**: Optimizing code is not that much easy 

### Day 9: September 08, 2022(Thursday)

**Today's Progress**: Solve day4 2/4 problem in leetcode programming L1 study plan

**Thoughts**: Today plan to start Bit manupulation concept but not started yet and loose the leetcode study plan strike

### Day 10: September 09, 2022(Friday)

**Today's Progress**: solve 2 leetcode problem
1. Happy Number
2. Find repeated char in string

**Thoughts**: Once I covered the array concept start to participate leetcode contest

### Day 11: September 10, 2022(Saturday)

**Today's Progress**: **üìçChapter 3: Bit Magic** Learn about bitwise operators

**Thoughts**: Bit always ultimate, using bit we perform lot of approach

### Day 12: September 11, 2022(Sunday)

**Today's Progress**: Solve some bit based problem and learn about,
1. Brains Kerningam's algorithm
2. Properties of XOR

### Day 13: September 12, 2022(Monday)

**Today's Progress**: solve 2(easy) + 1(medium) leetcode problem that is bit based and learn about effective approach in 2 GFG problem

**Thoughts**: Well productive day and leetcode medium problem take 2.5hrs to complete

### Day 14: September 12, 2022(Tuesday)

**Today's Progress**: Solve 1 bit problem in GFG  also try to solve, 'Max AND value pair in array' problem but get only Brute force, optimization is hard to understand for me

**Thoughts**: Max AND problem really take too much of time to solve and watch solu tutorial and understand the approach yep, atlast got the idea behind that

### Day 15: September 12, 2022(Wednesday)

**Today's Progress**: **üìçChapter4: Recursion** -- learn how func work, application of recursion, what is tile recursion and solve some basic problem to understand the recursion
